#' SwarmSVM: A Package for several Ensemble Support Vector Machine Models
#'
#' The SwarmSVM package contains three differenct Ensemble SVM models, 
#' they all train SVM models on subset of data and combine the results together. 
#' The three models are from the following three papers:
#' 
#' 1. Gu, Q., & Han, J. (2013). Clustered support vector machines. In proceedings of the sixteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics (pp. 307-315).
#' 2. Hsieh, C. J., Si, S., & Dhillon, I. S. (2013). A divide-and-conquer solver for kernel support vector machines. arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.0914.
